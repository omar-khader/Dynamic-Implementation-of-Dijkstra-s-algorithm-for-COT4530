
# Dynamic Dijkstra's Algorithm with GUI in C++

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in C++, designed to offer both command-line and graphical user interface (GUI) interaction. Developed as a group project of four members, this project was engineered using modern C++ standards, leveraging the **CATCH2** testing framework for robust unit testing and featuring a modular structure with two `.hpp` and two `.cpp` files.

Features:

* **Dynamic Graph Creation:** Supports real-time addition and removal of nodes and edges.
* **Efficient Path Calculation:** Implements Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path computation with user-defined source nodes.
* **User-Friendly GUI:** Offers an intuitive interface for visualizing the graph and interacting with Dijkstra's algorithm.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** Built with **CATCH2** to ensure accurate and reliable performance.
* **Scalable Design:** Modular codebase, easily extendable for further features.

Usage:

* Compile and run the program via the terminal using provided instructions.
* Access GUI mode for interactive graph manipulation.
* Run unit tests to verify functionality and correctness.

Technologies Used:

* C++ (Modern C++ Standards)
* CATCH2 (Unit Testing)
* Standard Template Library (STL) for optimized data structures
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) for enhanced user experience

Project Structure:

* **`main.cpp`** - Entry point of the program, handling CLI and GUI interactions.
* **`graph.hpp` / `graph.cpp`** - Defines the graph data structure and Dijkstra's algorithm implementation.
* **`gui.hpp` / `gui.cpp`** - Manages the graphical user interface.
* **`tests.cpp`** - Comprehensive test suite for all major components.

Highlights:

* Successfully presented to a full audience, receiving positive feedback.
* Awarded full marks for its design, functionality, and presentation quality.
